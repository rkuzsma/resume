## Already Read
* Slaughterhouse Five
* The 3 body problem. (book 1)
* Thinking, Fast and Slow
* Siddhartha by Hermann Hess - not bad, good story of the buddha, recommended by joe pontes.
* Pastwatch - interesting take on an alternate history of the world if Columbus acted differently
* Kings of the Wyld. (Schuft recommendation, so of course it was good) - fun fantasy book, narrator voice was hard to get used to though
* The birth of plenty -- good, but you can just read the 4 bullet summary of it. Wealth happened to humans once we had property rights, rationality, something something ...
* Soul of New Machine by Tracy Kidder (jeff recommended) - Good story written in 1981 about a team in Data General that built a 32 bit computer against odds. Really paints the landscape of Digital/DEC/Massacusetts early computer companies.
* Winterdance - AWESOME. 5 stars! Hilarious, exciting story of the iditerod.
* Ender's Game, then Ender's Shadow - top 5 favorite books of all time
* Accelerando. Nope. Too boring, didnt finish it.
* Old Man's War by scalsi -- good sci fi, felt like a short story but long, really enjoyed it
* Atomic Habits - Frank recommended -- 5 stars! Summarizes TAP and CFAR tricks well.
* Lord of the Flies - meh, narrator was boring. I remember it being a more interesting story when first reading it in high school. Story was so-so the 2nd time around.
* Scythe - AWESOME. 5 stars!
* Thunderhead and The Toll. Follow-up to Scythe. Frickin' amazing.
* The Happiness Hypothesis by Jonathan Haidt - speaker bored me, read a summary of the key bullet points of each chapter some day to refresh the points.
* A Fire Upon the Deep - meh
* Beneath a Scarlet Sky -- 1939 italy historical fiction. Outstanding. Teenagers should read it.
* The Achievement Trap, recommended by Iana. Decent and quick read.
* Snowcrash - classic sci-fi, pretty good, holds up
* Girl on the Train (boring and too long, i didnt care about any of the characters)
* Lessons of History by Durant (this book is terrible)
* 3 Body Problem (book 1 of 3) - pretty interesting
* Kurt Vonnegut Cats Cradle - A masterpiece.
* Homo Deus
* Sapiens
* Scale by Geoffrey West. Just read a summary online, or listen to Sam Harris' podcast with him. The book is too long, the author spends too much time name-dropping and propping himself up. Interesting scaling relationships exist in the world. Filled with interesting trivia, though.
* Algorithms to Live By. Part of Book Club - really good! approachable content.
* Straight from the Gut by Jack Welch. Fun to listen to. Really paints the picture of '80's corporate politics.
* Atlas Shrugged 
* Niall ferguson the ascent of money.
* Washington and Hamilton. Increased my appreciation for Washington's character in the early formation of the country.
* History of Warfare by John Keegan. Kind of long.
* The art of explanation. Decent.
* The other side of history.
* A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson. Fun!
* History of the World in 6 Glasses. Fun!
* Focusing audiobook by Eugene Gendlin. I tried the techniques, but probably not enough, so I didn't get value from it. Other than learning that most psychotherapy is bunk.
* Art of War by Sun Tzu. People rave about it. I thought it was OK. Some interesting points about warfare, mostly just fascinating how it has held up all these years.
* Guns Germs Steel Jared Diamond. Awesome, awesome, awesome. 5 stars! Required reading at Cornell.
* Charisma Myth (5 stars, read again)
* Peter Singer's TED talk on "The why and how of effective altruism"
* Mythical Man Month, Fred Brooks
* Becoming a Technical Leader, Gerald Weinberg
* Worm. 5 Stars! Frickin' amazing.
* Pact. Not as good as Worm.

And the best book of all time: [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](https://www.hpmor.com)
